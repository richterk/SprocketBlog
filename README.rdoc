== Welcome to Sprocket Blogging Framework

Sprocket Blogging Framework is written using the Rails framework.  It was built for a family member to start his own blog on the internet for sharing music.  It allows a creator to create users, assign permissions, and blog.

Further, SBF allows readers to comment on and rate blog posts.  SBF also allows a user to set up filters on the blog to only show certain posts on the page.

SBF will be expanded to add more features eventually, but the benefit of it is the ease of use and the compact featureset.
